# ForlornKnight

**ForlornKnight** is a story-rich 2D action-adventure game built in **Godot Engine**, following the journey of a nameless knight haunted by the past, burdened by prophecy, and caught between the fate of magic and the rise of a new world.

> _“Without a name, without a past, I walk the path of ruin and rebirth.”_

## About the Game

ForlornKnight is set in the decaying remnants of **Camelot**, where time and magic have fractured. As the **Nameless Knight**, you uncover your identity, confront ancient spirits, and shape the world through four possible endings — each a reflection of your choices, morality, and sacrifice.

### Core Features

- **Precision Combat** – Melee-focused, reactive combat with weighty weapons and spellcasting.
- **Ghosts of Camelot** – Interact with lingering souls, each with their own story and regrets.
- **Branching Narrative** – Four powerful endings, each representing a different fate for magic, Camelot, and yourself.
- **Regret & Redemption** – A central theme of identity, sacrifice, and the cost of power.
- **Lore-Driven Exploration** – Unearth relics, solve puzzles, and reveal the buried truths of a ruined kingdom.


## Built With

- [Godot Engine 4.x](https://godotengine.org/) – Open-source game engine
- GDScript – Primary scripting language
